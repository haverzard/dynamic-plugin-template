# Welcome to haverzard's Storybook

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

In this storybook, you can:
- develop your Chart components without having to create a React app
- mockup your dynamic plugin architecture
- check if your UI is responsive

An example mockup can be seen below or you can explore it more in the `Demo` section:
